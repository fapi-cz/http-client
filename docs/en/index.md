Extension
---
```yaml
extensions:
	httpClient: Fapi\HttpClient\Bidges\NetteDI\HttpClientExtension
```

Configuration options
---------------------

The default configuration options are

```yaml
httpClient:
	type: guzzle
	logging: false
	bar: false
```

Option `type` specifies the type of HTTP client to be used. Supported types are `guzzle` and `curl`.

Option `logging` enables logging of all HTTP requests, HTTP responses and HTTP client errors.

Option `bar` enables Tracy bar of all HTTP requests, HTTP responses and HTTP client errors.

You can use only `logging` or `bar` option. Both are not allowed for now.

## LoggingHttpClient
Logging supports Psr-3 `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`. If you are using `Tracy\ILogger` you can use bridge `Fapi\HttpClient\Bridges\Tracy\TracyToPsrLogger` to convert tracy to psr logger.

Log formatting:

You can create your own logging formatter. By implementing `ILoggingFormatter` and then passing your formatter into `LoggerHttpClient` as 3rd argument.
By default `BaseLoggingFormatter` is used.

```php
$loggingClient = new LoggingHttpClient(
	$httpClient,
	new TracyToPsrLogger(Debugger::getLogger()),
	new MyCustomLoggingFormatter()
);

```

## Making HTTP requests


Downloading Google homepage is as easy as

```php
$httpRequest = HttpRequest::from('https://www.google.com/');
$httpResponse = $httpClient->sendRequest($httpRequest);
```

The HTTP response object has methods for retrieving status code, response headers and response body.

## HTTP request options


Option `form_params` can be used for making POST request with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

```php
$httpRequest = HttpRequest::from('https://www.example.com/login', HttpMethod::POST, [
	'form_params' => [
		'username' => 'admin',
		'password' => 'xxx',
	],
]);
```

Option `headers` can be used for specifying HTTP request headers.

```php
$httpRequest = HttpRequest::from('https://www.google.com/', HttpMethod::GET, [
	'headers' => [
		'User-Agent' => 'Bot/1.0',
	],
]);
```

Option `auth` can be used for specifying credentials for HTTP basic authentication.

```php
$httpRequest = HttpRequest::from('https://www.example.com/private', HttpMethod::GET, [
	'auth' => ['admin', 'xxx'],
]);
```

Option `body` can be used for specifying request body.

```php
$httpRequest = HttpRequest::from('https://www.example.com/api', HttpMethod::POST, [
	'body' => 'Request body',
]);
```

Option `json` can be used for specifying request body data, which should be serialized to JSON before sending.

```php
$httpRequest = HttpRequest::from('https://www.example.com/api', HttpMethod::POST, [
	'json' => [
		'foo' => 'bar',
	],
]);
```

~~Option `cookies` can be used for specifying a cookie jar. This option is only supported by the Guzzle HTTP client.~~

Option `cookies` is no more supported.


Option `connect_timeout` can be used for specifing connection time limit.

```php
$httpRequest = HttpRequest::from('https://www.example.com/', HttpMethod::GET, [
	'connect_timeout' => 3,
]);
```

Option `timeout` can be used for specifing response time limit.

```php
$httpRequest = HttpRequest::from('https://www.example.com/', HttpMethod::GET, [
	'timeout' => 3,
]);
```

## Redirects


If you want to follow redirects, use RedirectHelper after sending HTTP request.

```php
$httpResponse = $httpClient->sendHttpRequest($httpRequest);
$httpResponse = RedirectHelper::followRedirects($httpClient, $httpResponse, $originHttpRequest);
```

## Mocking HTTP clients


Let's assume you want to test class `Foo` which uses an HTTP client.

```php
namespace SampleProjectTests;

use Fapi\HttpClient\CapturingHttpClient;
use Fapi\HttpClient\GuzzleHttpClient;
use SampleProject\Foo;
use SampleProjectTests\MockHttpClients\FooMockHttpClient;
use Tester\Assert;
use Tester\TestCase;


class FooTest extends TestCase
{

	/**
	 * @var CapturingHttpClient|FooMockHttpClient
	 */
	private $httpClient;


	public function __construct()
	{
		$this->httpClient = new CapturingHttpClient(
			new GuzzleHttpClient(),
			__DIR__ . '/MockHttpClients/FooMockHttpClient.php',
			'SampleProjectTests\MockHttpClients\FooMockHttpClient'
		);
	}


	public function __destruct()
	{
		$this->httpClient->close();
	}


	public function testDownloadData()
	{
		$foo = new Foo($this->httpClient);
		Assert::same(42, $foo->downloadData());
	}
}
```

After the test succeeds, stored requests and responses are written to mock file. Next time you run tests MockHttpClient is used. 

You can always update the mock client by deleting generated file.

The tests will then be deterministic. You will be able to run them even without an Intenet connection or when the remote service is down. Furthermore, they will run much faster.

## REST HTTP client


You can use class `RestClient` for accessing JSON REST APIs protected by HTTP basic authentication. It provides methods for creating, getting, updating and deleting resources.
